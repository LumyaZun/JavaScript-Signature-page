# JavaScript-Signature-page
signature page in javascript made for my internship project

During my steps during my BTS, I had to create a web application for my company which allows to record a support of a customer, as well as his information linked to a MySQL database.

For support, I created a page in JavaScript allowing the customer to sign on a phone or tablet.

This signature was then retrieved as an image in a file and then displayed in a PDF created in PHP.
